# Pixel-Art
Ok - I know this is not a typical repository

Reason I created it?

As I progress with Game Development I have found it a valuable skill to be able to create your OWN sprites and character art-work
for lo-level 2D style games.

Those who aren't too good with drawing and art work - this really isn't too hard, so I wanted to share the process with you all - and show how it is done with a simple and well known sprite / character - the Mushroom from the classic Mario games.


So firstly develop your skills with a simple pixel-art project - I chose the Mario Mushroom

Now....Either search Google images for a pixelated image - and copy it out block by block. I have 2 methods for doing this. There are a number of Paint like programs for creating pixel art, that allow you to make a grid and fill in the blocks with the chosen colors...

I do most of my editing (audio and graphics) on my Raspberry Pi - I use X-Paint and Graff-X for graphics, and Audacity for Audio 

Also - the method I show here is to take some Graph Paper - about 0.5 cm or 5mm and draw your blocks/pixels that way. If you dont have graph paper, just get a pen, paper, ruler and draw your grid.

I also use minecraft as a fun way to create pixel images - and it really helps to build up your skills!

RESOURCES
============

I found a cool resource - it is actually a cross-stitch website that lets you upload ANY image, and it pixellates it into a grid and blocks, for stitching a pattern....it allows you to select the size of the grid (detail level) and also use ANY colours. This means you can take any image, even your own hand drawn ones, take a pic using your phone or something, or scan it, then use the site to pixelate it - then just copy it out

Hand Drawing is a good way to get your character designed firstly - you really get a feel for the design that way.

Use a pencil and just roughly mark out the outline blocks - counting how many across and up, then draw them in with a black felt-tip pen. Then colour them in, and lastly I repeat the process for the inner colours.
